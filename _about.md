We're a group of mostly-young people who want to see abundant housing in Brisbane. 

We come from the same impetus that has launched the [Abundant Housing Network Australia][1], [Greater Canberra][2], [YIMBY Melbourne][3] and [Sydney YIMBY][4].

More is coming soon! Until then, you can chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fcr74BgzZU) or by [email](hello@greaterbrisbane.org).
