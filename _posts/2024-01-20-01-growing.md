**We believe Brisbane is a city that can be home to everyone.**

Our city can be a welcoming place to people from all over the world and from all walks of life. 

To be that welcoming place, we need to build up our city.

Our city’s urban fabric is broken, with skyscrapers crashing into millionaire’s mansions. 

This unequal distribution of development is bad for our communities, bad for our economy and bad for the environment.

By rethinking our city’s urban fabric, we can build out Brisbane’s missing middle housing, making homes more affordable and more sustainable in desirable parts of the city.

We need to unlock our established middle ring suburbs to more intensive development. If we do this, we will unlock billions in investment and build a stronger building industry — while making our city more affordable and giving people more choices about how they want to live.


We can’t afford to only build in our city’s heart and outer fringes.
