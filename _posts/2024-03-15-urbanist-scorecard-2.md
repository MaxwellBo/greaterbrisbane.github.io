With polling day tomorrow, let's recap our scorecard.

And that is: it was a bust.

The candidates for Lord Mayor didn't want to be drawn on planning outside of what they've already announced.

Disappointing result - but shows how important campaigning for more homes is.

We'll be doing another one of these in the lead-up to October's state election and you better believe we'll be fighting tooth and nail for these changes to go into this year's City Plan rewrite.


But luckily Matt Dennien and Tony Moore at Brisbane Times did a write up of the major parties' housing announcements to save us the hassle!
