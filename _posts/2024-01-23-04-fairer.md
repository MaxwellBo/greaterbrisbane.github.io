Our city is an unfair place.

Renters have a raw deal with Queensland lagging behind on renters rights.

![Graphic of rental conditions. Australian leases are shorter (6-12 months, vs 2-3 years or indefinite). Our notice periods are shorter (1 month, vs 2 or 3). Our leases can be terminated for more reasons. Pets are restricted. Minor alterations, like hanging pictures, are very rare.](/assets/images/04-fairer/fig_7_4_rental_conditions.png)

Our homes and streets are hostile places to people with mobility issues.

Our city doesn’t have enough options for people to downsize and comfortably age in place.

And our social housing waitlist grows every year wth no end in sight.

While the vast majority of people will live in privately built and owned housing for the foreseeable future, we want to see much greater investment in non-market housing — whether that’s public and social homes, a cooperative housing sector or new public-commons developers.


We want to see fairer rental regulation, housing and homelessness services and better investment in making homes and neighbourhoods more accessible to everyone.


Housing abundance means abundance for everyone, not just those lucky enough to have the money and health for it.
