Brisbane has all the ingredients for good urban planning.

But despite having the zoning and governance structures to make other cities jealous, Brisbane still has a housing affordability crisis and a broken urban fabric.

We want a new paradigm for Brisbane’s planning with broad upzoning across the entire city to unlock everywhere within an hour’s walk of Brisbane’s CBD and within fifteen minutes’ walk of public transport hubs for high density mixed use development.

We want to overturn Brisbane City Council’s short-sighted “townhouse ban” that stops gentle density in our suburbs and puts downsizing in place out of reach of our aging population.

We want to investigate how to better facilitate lot and strata title consolidation to build more neighbourhood scale developments.

Brisbane’s metropolitan scale governance is perfectly placed to be a national leader in planning and housing reform. 

We can set a new global standard for human-scale development in the tropics if only we were bold enough to redesign our planning system to deliver it.
