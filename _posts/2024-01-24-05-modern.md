Building this better city means compromises. We can’t keep the status quo and make all this happen at the same time.

For too long, the balance has swung too hard in favour of millionaire homeowners and a ravenous real estate industry. 


Bad faith actors weaponise our planning and heritage regulations to lock people out of their neighbourhoods.


Whether it’s character neighbourhoods or excessive appeal rights, regulatory handbrakes on development exclude young people, renters and aspirational residents from our most desirable suburbs — without delivering the promise of a better urban fabric.


We need a reset.


We want to reform our planning and heritage regulations, review our tax system and rethink our city’s governance to better deliver for young people.


We want to work with government and industry to develop new consultation processes to make sure renters’ and aspirational residents’ voices are heard.


We want to celebrate what's great about modern high density homes and the neighbourhoods they create — and tear down that barriers that stop private investment in the kind of neighbourhoods we want to live in.


Let’s build up private, government and commons development sectors and build more homes where people want to live.
