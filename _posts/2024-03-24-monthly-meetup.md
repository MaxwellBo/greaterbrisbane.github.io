***Our monthly urbanist meetup is this Sunday at Merthyr Bowls!***

Just a quick update to let you know about our monthly casual urbanists meetup this Sunday 24th March, starting at 2pm.

![2pm, 24th March, Merthyr Bowls Club, 60 Oxlade Drive, New Farm; near New Farm Ferry or Bus Route 196.](/assets/images/events/2024-03-24-meetup.jpeg)

We got our start last year as just a few dozen renters, public and active transport enthusiasts and urban optimists who caught up for a beer and a chat about the state of our city.

And we want to keep that energy going. 

Our monthly meetups are a casual affair where we can talk about housing, planning, transport and everything else cities  â€” and plot what our next moves are.

We'll be thinking about what the repercussions of the Brisbane City Council election will be, what our submissions to the City Plan review will look like and start thinking about our policy asks for October's state election.
