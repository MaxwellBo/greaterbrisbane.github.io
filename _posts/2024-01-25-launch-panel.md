Join Greater Brisbane, our city's newest urbanist collective, for our launch panel featuring some of Brisbane's leading urban thinkers. 

Come to the Polish Club in Milton for a chat and a drink and listen to what the experts think the next four years hold for our city:

**What do Brisbaneâ€™s local elections mean for our housing future?**

The last year has seen the climate and housing crises come to a head in Brisbane, between floods, heatwaves, crippling rents and collapsing building approvals. The coming year is an opportunity to turn this around. 

With the upcoming Council election signalling a possible change in administration for the first time in twenty years, a major revision to the City Plan due in coming months, and a state and federal government both committed to serious action on housing, 2024 is shaping up to reshape our city's future. 

We have gathered some of Brisbane's top urban thinkers to present their vision for what a new Council administration can do to turn these crises around - and whether the visions already presented by the three major parties are up to the challenge. 

We'll be joined by economist Stuart Donovan, geographer Rachel Gallagher, built environment research Dr Dorina Pojani and lawyer Ken Baar.

How can Brisbane City Council build more homes where people want to live?

**Numbers are limited** due to space constraints.
