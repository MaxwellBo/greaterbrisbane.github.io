Our first meetup for the year is 6PM, Thursday 18th January at the Scratch Bar in Milton. 

We’re looking to start the ball rolling on a soft launch event in February/March as a panel of industry and academic experts discussing each party’s vision and what their policy Wishlist would be for planning, housing, development and transport in the lead-up to the Brisbane City Council in March. 

We’re also looking to get buy in to formally incorporate, affiliate with the Abundant Housing Network, and agree to an interim strategy for Greater Brisbane, [which everyone can read and comment on here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yh7f9usOHpLhW_wpUAiqapPyqAyC0lCaEYcTR3dO4J4/edit)
